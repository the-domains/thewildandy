description: 'Get mad, but stay grateful This post is meant for anyone who is demoralised, overlooked, dismissed, or feels like you’ve got the odds stacked against you. At many points in your life, you might have felt like you haven’t met society’s expectations of what you should be. You’re too quiet, too loud, too fat, too thin, too driven, too relaxed, too introverted, too extroverted, too poor, too rich, too male, too female, the list goes on. Somehow in today’s world, being different isn’t okay, and the pressure to be perfect is overwhelming — and frankly, impossible. It’s no wonder you feel at a frustratingly constant disadvantage if you don’t fit the mould of the stereotypically successful person. But you’re not alone. And it’s not game over. I want to talk about rising up against the odds; turning your weaknesses into strengths, and why you should outright refuse to let the world hold you back. For context, here’s a quick list of traits I typically get stereotyped on: Female Young (and I look even younger than I am) Asian Short Introverted I can’t drink (God, the flak I get for this!) But not everyone faces prejudice on the same attributes that I do. Sometimes you get disapproval for the most surprising of things. What are some characteristics you get stereotyped on? 1.You can’t be entitled (so work on the value you bring). I may not fit perfectly into the stereotypical categories so often (subliminally) subscribed to, and that’s okay. Like many, I didn’t luck out on getting my seat at the table, I worked for it and got there on skills and tenacity. And while this negativity can be frustrating, you have to be very careful not to fall into the trap of thinking “dammit all, I didn’t get this opportunity because I’m not (insert admired trait).” It’s easier said than done, and I’ve personally fallen into this trap many times. The more difficult but better way to look at this is: never being able to rely on external attributes means you’ll always consciously know what you bring to the table AND be able to communicate that — because you could never coast on the attributes you don’t possess. Getting creative and working really damn hard is so much easier when you’re not used to easily getting what you want. And since you never expect to get opportunities based off how you appear, this means when you go after something you want, you’ll know it’s something you actually want. 2. Get used to surpassing their expectations, but never get used to surpassing yours. I’ve encountered many people who seem surprised but impressed with what I’ve managed to achieve so far. It’s awesome to receive! But I sometimes wonder if it’s only impressive because they wouldn’t expect that from someone who looks like me. Despite how lovely this is to hear, no matter how many times this happens, I’m always caught off-guard. I’ve never been surprised nor impressed with what I’ve done. Why? Because I’ve spent most of my life never being good enough. I never had someone tell me “you’re good enough”, and so the bar has never been set for what’s “enough”. And because there is no bar, I have no limitations. I reach for the stars because no one has told me “the ceiling is fine”. 3. You won’t be ‘one of them’ (so just be ‘one of you’). That stings. Whether someone says it to your face, or turns away to talk only to people similar to them, that feeling of rejection and injustice will always hurt. But when you accept that you aren’t be ‘one of them’ — whoever ‘them’ may be, you’re free from expectations. You’ll never fit in, so why hurt yourself trying so hard? Now you have the freedom to be you. Do what you want to do, try what you want to try, or say no without feeling the need to fit in. A life led on your own terms will always feel better than one led for others. You can’t be one of them — so what? Just be ‘you’. 4. Be hard on yourself. Constant dismissal amplifies a critical inner voice. Sometimes it’s turned externally to criticise others, but most times, that voice is exceptionally loud in your head, constantly asking “what’s wrong with me?” You’re not perfect. No one is. You have flaws and weaknesses and blind spots. Everyone else does too. But when you have an inner critical voice, you have no choice but to spend time trying to figure out what you might be lacking. Now, how you approach that voice is what really counts. You could be so hard on yourself that you sink to the ground and never try to fix your issues. You could also slide into denial and pretend that the world will love you regardless or even because of your flaws. Or you could start fixing the things you can (I dislike public speaking; I’m shy), letting go of things you can’t (I’m not a networker; I hate events) and start finding ways to turn weaknesses into advantages (I don’t network, so I make close connections; I’m different, so I’m easily memorable; I’m an introvert, so a happy consequence is that I have more time to focus on work). You might end up being hard on yourself, but that’s essential for personal growth. 5. Get mad, then get grateful. Very often, people either a) get defeated; b) get bitter; c) get a chip on their shoulder, or in the worst case scenario, all of the above. None of the above are what you should strive for. When you’re angry that you can’t have a certain “trait”, you’re needlessly angry and bitter. Bitter anger eats you up inside, but does absolutely nothing to the people you’re angry at. When you get mad at being dismissed all the time, you approach people with your walls up. Walls might protect you, but they also keep you lonely and resentful. Don’t get mad at people; it does you no good. Get mad at the action: the condescension, the sexism, the injustice, the racism, the unfairness. Get mad at the “system”. We’re all victims to the system — prejudice and biases developed over decades and centuries that have gained so much momentum, you will never be able to single-handedly stop them all. It’s there, and it’s not your fault. So get mad at how the world is, then get grateful that despite these odds, you’re still lucky enough to be living in a world where you can make it. Get mad, but stay grateful. It’s a weird but powerful combination that moves mountains. What else would you add? How have you personally managed to make it despite the odds? Tweet me your thoughts and experiences at @thedesignnomad — I’d love to hear from you.'

Get mad, but stay grateful

This post is meant for anyone who is demoralised, overlooked, dismissed, or feels like you've got the odds stacked against you. 

At many points in your life, you might have felt like you haven't met society's expectations of what you should be. You're too quiet, too loud, too fat, too thin, too driven, too relaxed, too introverted, too extroverted, too poor, too rich, too male, too female, the list goes on.

> Somehow in today's world, being different isn't okay, and the pressure to be perfect is overwhelming --- and frankly, impossible. 

It's no wonder you feel at a frustratingly constant disadvantage if you don't fit the mould of the stereotypically successful person. 

But you're not alone. And it's not game over. 

I want to talk about rising up against the odds; turning your weaknesses into strengths, and why you should outright refuse to let the world hold you back. 

For context, here's a quick list of traits I typically get stereotyped on: 

* Female
* Young (and I look even younger than I am) 
* Asian 
* Short 
* Introverted 
* I **can't** drink (God, the flak I get for this!) 

But not everyone faces prejudice on the same attributes that I do. Sometimes you get disapproval for the most surprising of things. What are some characteristics you get stereotyped on? 

## 1.You can't be entitled (so work on the value you bring). 

I may not fit perfectly into the stereotypical categories so often (subliminally) subscribed to, and that's okay. Like many, I didn't luck out on getting my seat at the table, I worked for it and got there on skills and tenacity. 

And while this negativity can be frustrating, you have to be very careful not to fall into the trap of thinking "dammit all, I didn't get this opportunity because I'm not (insert admired trait)." It's easier said than done, and I've personally fallen into this trap many times. 

The more difficult but better way to look at this is: never being able to rely on external attributes means you'll always consciously know what you bring to the table AND be able to communicate that --- because you could never coast on the attributes you don't possess.

And since you never expect to get opportunities based off how you appear, this means when you go after something you want, you'll know it's something you actually want. 

## 2\. Get used to surpassing their expectations, but never get used to surpassing yours. 

I've encountered many people who seem surprised but impressed with what I've managed to achieve so far. It's awesome to receive! But I sometimes wonder if it's only impressive because they wouldn't expect that from someone who looks like me. 

Despite how lovely this is to hear, no matter how many times this happens, I'm always caught off-guard. I've never been surprised nor impressed with what I've done. 

Why? Because I've spent most of my life never being good enough. I never had someone tell me "you're good enough", and so the bar has never been set for what's "enough". And because there is no bar, I have no limitations. I reach for the stars because no one has told me "the ceiling is fine". 

## 3\. You won't be 'one of them' (so just be 'one of you'). 

That stings. Whether someone says it to your face, or turns away to talk only to people similar to them, that feeling of rejection and injustice will always hurt. 

But when you accept that you aren't be 'one of them' --- whoever 'them' may be, you're free from expectations. You'll never fit in, so why hurt yourself trying so hard? 

Now you have the freedom to be you. Do what you want to do, try what you want to try, or say no without feeling the need to fit in. 

A life led on your own terms will always feel better than one led for others. You can't be one of them --- so what? Just be 'you'. 

## 4\. Be hard on yourself. 

Constant dismissal amplifies a critical inner voice. Sometimes it's turned externally to criticise others, but most times, that voice is exceptionally loud in your head, constantly asking "what's wrong with me?" 

You're not perfect. No one is. You have flaws and weaknesses and blind spots. Everyone else does too. 

But when you have an inner critical voice, you have no choice but to spend time trying to figure out what you might be lacking. 

Now, how you approach that voice is what really counts. 

You could be so hard on yourself that you sink to the ground and never try to fix your issues. You could also slide into denial and pretend that the world will love you regardless or even because of your flaws. 

Or you could start fixing the things you can (_I dislike public speaking; I'm shy_), letting go of things you can't (_I'm not a networker; I hate events_) and start finding ways to turn weaknesses into advantages (_I don't network, so I make close connections; I'm different, so I'm easily memorable; I'm an introvert, so a happy consequence is that I have more time to focus on work_). 

You might end up being hard on yourself, but that's essential for personal growth. 

## 5\. Get mad, then get grateful. 

Very often, people either a) get defeated; b) get bitter; c) get a chip on their shoulder, or in the worst case scenario, all of the above. 

None of the above are what you should strive for. 

When you're angry that you can't have a certain "trait", you're needlessly angry and bitter. Bitter anger eats you up inside, but does absolutely nothing to the people you're angry at. 

When you get mad at being dismissed all the time, you approach people with your walls up. Walls might protect you, but they also keep you lonely and resentful. 

Don't get mad at people; it does you no good. 

Get mad at the action: the condescension, the sexism, the injustice, the racism, the unfairness. 

Get mad at the "system". We're all victims to the system --- prejudice and biases developed over decades and centuries that have gained so much momentum, you will never be able to single-handedly stop them all. 

It's there, and it's not your fault. So get mad at how the world is, then get grateful that despite these odds, you're still lucky enough to be living in a world where you **can** make it. 

## Get mad, but stay grateful. It's a weird but powerful combination that moves mountains. 

What else would you add? How have you personally managed to make it despite the odds? Tweet me your thoughts and experiences at [@thedesignnomad ][0]--- I'd love to hear from you.
